Boost your Elementor with some fresh and yet innovative options.

== Description ==

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMkazBFTpkE&t=2s]

An awesome set of tools, options and settings that expand Elementor defaults. Instead of creating new Elementor Widgets, these act like an upgrade of existing options or the self-standing panels thing. 

= NEW ADD-ON NOW AVAILABLE - TELEPORTER =

More awesome Column controls that include teleporting background settings of particular column to the parent Section or the Column wrapper.

= In the package so far =

1. HARAKIRI 
Allows you to change the writing mode (CSS property writing-mode) of Elementor's Heading and Text Editor widgets.

2. POOPART
Add an overlay or underlay ghost-element to any Elementor Widget. By adding a mask image to these, and/or combining them with CSS filters, blend mode, a wow effect is inevitable. Oh, yes, you can also resize and reposition these if you like.

3. OVERLAIZ
From now on, you can move the Background Overlay in any direction, as well as to resize it. Creating overlapping columns is now piece of cake.

4. PAGININI
Your frustration with styling up the posts pagination in Elementor is now officially over.

5. BREAKING BAD
Tailor the Section columns at will! Set the custom width, height and let them collapse naturally.

6. GLIDER
Generate the slider out of Section and columns with one click only!

7. PHOTOGIRAFFE
Make any Image full-height

8. TELEPORTER
An awesome Coulmn hover controls

9. MORE TO COME SOON!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use OoohBoi Steroids? =

It depends on the widgets that you are editing. For example, if you are about to style Heading widget or Text Editor widget, HARAKIRI options will show up.
All the POOPART options can be found under "Advanced" tab, POOPART panel.
Rest assured, you won't miss them because there will always be an eye-catching icon next to the set of options (or the panel title).

= Do I need Elementor PRO with this add-on? =

No, you don't. It'll work with both free version of Elementor and Elementor PRO.
